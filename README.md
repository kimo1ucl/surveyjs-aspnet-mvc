## About
This is a fork of the original surveyjs / surveyjs-aspnet-mvc backend. By doing a in the project we can use stored json files to persist our survey. In the original project, surveys (and results) are stored as session objects, so they will disappear, when the demo session exists.

## Disclaimer

This demo must not be used as a real service as it doesn't cover such real-world survey service aspects as authentication, authorization, user management, access levels, and different security issues. These aspects are covered by backend-specific articles, forums, and documentation.
